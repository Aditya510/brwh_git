Explanation of the idea
We view the ability of an engineer as their ability to have impact on a team. Most utilities focus on coding ability, but as well as this, we feel engineers require ability to work to build a system.
We measure impact in three ways; through potential impact, world impact and team impact.
We use novel technologies, including an ‘insipiration coefficient’ that depends on graph theory, as well as predicting the growth of an engineer’s potential impact using predictor ML algorithms.
